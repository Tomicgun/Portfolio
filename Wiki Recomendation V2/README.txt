Hello Welcome Wiki Recommendation version 2, this takes 200 wiki links and creates a serialized file for each URL that contains its tf-idf values, and some other bookkeeping. It then takes in a URL and return two similar wiki URLs.

This program takes 6 hours to build, and this problem is solved in version 3, However I wish to keep the truth of my growth through these three projects.
